# Hello World

This is a sample post to demonstrate how writings work.

## How to add new writings

1. Create a new `.md` file in `src/writings/` (e.g., `my-post.md`)
2. Add metadata to `src/data/writings.json`:

```json
{
  "title": "My Post Title",
  "excerpt": "Short summary for listings",
  "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "slug": "my-post"
}
```

The slug must match the markdown filename (without `.md`).

## Markdown Support

You can use all standard markdown features:

- **Bold** and *italic* text
- Lists and numbered lists
- Code blocks
- And more!

Happy writing!
